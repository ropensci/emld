Description: Transform Ecological Metadata Language ('EML') files into 'JSON-LD'
             and back into 'EML'.  This allows us to treat all 'EML' fields as 
             linked data that can easily be serialized to 'RDF' and queried with
             'SPARQL'.  Further, the 'JSON-LD' format is both simpler and more
             flexible than the 'XML' based 'EML' format, corresponding naturally
             to nested list objects in R. These lists can be flattened, compacted,
             and re-framed with the standard 'JSON-LD' operations, making them 
             easier to work with for users and developers while maintaining a 1:1
             mapping into the original 'EML' schema. Several vignettes illustrate the
             utility of these approaches.
